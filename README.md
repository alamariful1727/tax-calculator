# Tax Calculator

My task is to build an application that queries an API and displays the calculated total income tax for a given salary and tax year.

#### Accomplished the following:

- Fetch the tax rates by year i.e. **/tax-calculator/tax-year/2022**
- Receive a yearly salary
- Calculate and display the total taxes owed for the salary
- Display the effective rate
- Display the amount of taxes owed per band

If you want know how I setup my **react** project with **tailwindcss**, **typescript**, **eslint**, **prettier** & **husky**, you can check it [here](https://github.com/alamariful1727/react-tailwindcss).

## Developed With

- API called with [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/)
- Form managed by [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- Styled with [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Global error handled with [react-error-boundary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-error-boundary)

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/alamariful1727/tax-calculator.git
   ```
2. Install packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` and create a new file named `env.local`
   ```js
    REACT_APP_API_URL=<ENTER API URL>
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run lint`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
